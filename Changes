1.99    CHANGES:
         * Better implementation of inet_pton() that sets correct size (RT 75074)
         * Added SO_DOMAIN
         * More robust unit tests of address-mangling functions

1.98    CHANGES:
         * Detect presence of sockaddr_in6 and ipv6_mreq; conditionally build
           pack/unpack functions on this
         * Back-compatibility improvements for older perls, back as far as
           5.6.1 (thanks Zefram)
         * Fix for picky compilers or platforms on which size_t doesn't
           printf() correctly by %d
         * Suppress some harmless compile-time warnings about unused variables

1.97    CHANGES:
         * Rewritten Makefile.PL configure-time logic to use only core's
           ExtUtils::CBuilder rather than CPAN's ExtUtils::CChecker
         * Fix implementation of synthesized newSVpvn_flags() to also work on
           threaded 5.10.0
         * Set INSTALLDIRS=perl on perl before 5.11; required as it's
           replacing a core module

1.96    CHANGES:
         * Fix Socket.t to use ok() instead of is() where required - RT73039
         * Complete rewrite of module docs; list all the constants and
           functions, updated SYNOPSIS
         * Added convenient Exporter tag :addrinfo for all the gai/gni-related
           symbols
         * Provide static synthesized newSVpvn_flags() replacement for older
           Perls
         * Implement getnameinfo() NIx_NOHOST and NIx_NOSERV extension flags

1.95    CHANGES:
         * Implement the remaining AI_*, EAI_* and NI_* constants from
           Socket::GetAddrInfo
         * Declare configure-time dependency on ExtUtils::Constants 0.23 for
           when building out of core
         * Initial attempt at dual-life extraction from bleadperl
