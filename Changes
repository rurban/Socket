Revision history for Socket

         * Implement the remaining AI_*, EAI_* and NI_* constants from
           Socket::GetAddrInfo
         * Bugfix to tests - only test inet_ntop with AF_INET6 if it's
           actually supported

1.94_06 CHANGES:
         * Don't use croak_xs_usage because xsubpp doesn't create one before
           perl 5.10

1.94_05 CHANGES:
         * Don't actually need to dVAR in getaddrinfo/getnameinfo; might
           improve portability to perl 5.8

         * Declare configure-time dependency on ExtUtils::Constants 0.23
